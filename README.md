# Census-Bureau-Database---Python-Project
This is a project on data exploration on Census Bureau Database extracted from http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/DES/www/welcome.html. 
Below is the jupyter notebook project link 
http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Census%20Bureau%20Database%20-%20Data%20Analysis%20with%20Pandas.ipynb

This project showcases my skill with programming in Python using jupyter notebook.
In this project i performed;
- Data analysis using Pandas.
- Data pre-processing methods.
- Analyzed and summarise dataset by finding facts from the data.

In this project, i used Pandas to read Adult dataset and to perform some basic analysis to showcase my understanding of the dataset and answer some questions with the data.
I read the dataset into a dataframe and performing basic analysis to gain first-hand understanding of the dataset i was working on such as what are the minimum and maximum values in the dataset, whether there are NULL values exist in the dataset, summarising data using 'groupby', 'valuecounts' etc. Before building models or form any hypothesis, it was important that i gained these useful insights of the dataset. As it gave a direction of what type of stories to tell or could be discovered from dataset.

I also used Matplotlib for Data visualisation and performed some data analysis and pre-processing, which and important phases of data mining.
